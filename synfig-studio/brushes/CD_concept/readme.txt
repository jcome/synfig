A briefs words...
-----------------
"Concept Design" idea comes from conceptual design, where Markers and inks are very useful. I thought that it would be fun to have something similar inside mypaint so i made them.in this set we have 16 brushes with specific functions to improve the workflows and productivity.
so please, feel free to change order, mix with other sets or whatever you want.

Install notes
-------------
When install popup menu appears, select "OK" to install and then select the "Rename all" option if you want to have an independent set, or "Replace all" if you want to remove the older brushes.
